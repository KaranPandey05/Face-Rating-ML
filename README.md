# Face-Rating-ML
A python ML program that rates a person's facial beauty from 1-5.

# Facial Attractiveness Rating System

This project uses machine learning to rate the attractiveness of facial images on a scale from 1 to 5. Leveraging a dataset of images with human-provided ratings, the program can analyze and score new images based on perceived facial attractiveness.

## Overview

The Facial Attractiveness Rating System is built using Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It processes input images, evaluates them using a trained model, and returns a rating from 1 to 5. This project demonstrates the application of deep learning in aesthetic evaluations and provides a tool for automated attractiveness scoring.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV and TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator to preprocess input images.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Employs TensorFlow and PyTorch to build and train the attractiveness rating model.
- **User Input Handling**: Accepts user-provided images and returns a rating based on the trained model.
- **Visualization**: Uses Matplotlib for visualizing image data and model performance.
